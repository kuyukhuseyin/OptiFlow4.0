# OptiFlow4.0

# 1. Algorithm Selection
• Johnson Algorithm: Optimal sorting for 2 machines (n×2 problems)
• CDS Algorithm: Multi-machine problems (n×m)
• Branch-and-Bound Algorithm: A systematic enumeration method that provides a guaranteed optimal solution. It is especially suitable for medium-sized problems in the range of 5-15 jobs

# 2. Determining the Problem Size
• Job and machine numbers are entered in accordance with the selected algorithm.

# 3. Processing Time Entry
• Processing times of the machines are entered for each job.
• Times must be integers ≥ 0.

# 4. Results
• Optimal Order: Listed with job numbers (Example: [3, 1, 2]).
• Makespan: Total completion time (Example: 14 time units).
• Calculation Time: Algorithm running time (seconds).
• Gantt Chart
